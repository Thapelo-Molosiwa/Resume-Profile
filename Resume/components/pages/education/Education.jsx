          I matriculated from Boikagong Secondary School in the year 2014, where
          I laid the foundation for my academic journey. During my time at
          Boikagong Secondary School, I gained valuable knowledge and developed
          important skills that would later contribute to my academic and
          personal growth.

          After completing my secondary education, I pursued further learning at
          CodeSpace Academy, where I graduated in December 2023. CodeSpace
          Academy provided me with a cutting-edge education in technology and
          coding, equipping me with the skills necessary to thrive in the
          rapidly evolving world of software development.
